# ðŸš€ Quickstart

Run the website locally

```
git clone https://github.com/harshhhdev/snip.git
```

## Setting up the development environment

```bash
cd snip

# Install deps
yarn
```

## Setting up the database

NOTE: This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/database) to store data. Things like authentication are handled by Supabase.

Currently, according to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-cli), there isn't any 'right' way to do migrations, however you can initialise your database with the `initdb.sql` file located at the root of the project.

## Authentication 

This application uses [Supabase's Authentication](https://supabase.com/auth) with the [GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-github) and [GitLab](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-gitlab). Refer to the linked guides for how to create an OAuth application and connect it with your account.

## Starting server

```bash
# Start the server
yarn dev
```

Server should now be running on [localhost](https://localhost:3000)

If you would also like to run the [Netlify serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/14/write-netlify-functions-in-rust/), you can start with the [netlify dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/cli/) command.

```bash
# Start the Netlify server
netlify dev
```

...and your local development server should now be running on [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).
